## üìÇ API Endpoints

Here are the available API endpoints:

### Root Route `/`
The root route provides a welcome message and displays:
- **Server Status**: Shows uptime and current time (in GMT/BST).
- **Available Endpoints**: Lists accessible routes in the API.
- **Recent Updates**: Displays dynamic updates loaded from a JSON file.

### Testing Route `/testing`
This endpoint provides random **facts** about the **first computer chip**. Each response includes:
- A **random fact** about the history of the chip.
- A **royalty-free image** associated with the fact.
- The current **Unix timestamp**.

#### Example response from `/testing`:
```json
{
  "id": "fact1",
  "testText": "Behold the wondrous tale of the silicon marvel known as the first computer chip!",
  "testImg": "https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=1",
  "dateUnixUK": 1693939200
}
